# Chanson a Repondre UNO

## Live web application

https://jameshpdy-dev.github.io/CHANSON-A-REPONDRE-UNO/

The GitHub Pages build hosts the complete Flutter Web frontend. AI Chat and
Card Transcription additionally require a separately hosted HTTPS backend.

## Card transcription and AI chat

Production builds use the secure proxy in `server/`; the OpenAI key never enters Flutter storage or a distributed application binary. OpenAI API billing is separate from ChatGPT subscriptions.

## Supabase application authentication

Create a Supabase project, then open **Authentication -> Providers -> Email** and enable the Email provider. Copy the project URL and publishable key (or legacy anon key) from the project API settings. The application rejects missing values and placeholders such as `YOUR_PROJECT`.

For the deployed GitHub Pages app, configure **Authentication -> URL Configuration** in Supabase:

```text
Site URL:
https://jameshpdy-dev.github.io/CHANSON-A-REPONDRE-UNO/

Redirect URL:
https://jameshpdy-dev.github.io/CHANSON-A-REPONDRE-UNO/#/profile
```

The Flutter production build must receive only client-safe values:

```text
AI_BACKEND_URL
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SKIP_AUTH_FOR_DEVELOPMENT=false
```

Do not use a Supabase `service_role` key, database password, OpenAI key, access token, or refresh token in Flutter or GitHub Pages build variables.

Launch Flutter with real public client configuration:

```powershell
flutter run -d windows `
  --dart-define=AI_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 `
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://REAL_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co `
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=REAL_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
```

For local UI work only, a debug build can bypass the login gate with `--dart-define=SKIP_AUTH_FOR_DEVELOPMENT=true`. Release builds ignore this flag. UI bypass mode never sends a fake bearer token and disables transcription/chat submission until a genuine Supabase session exists.

## Local Development

Create the ignored local configuration file:

```powershell
Copy-Item `
  config/local.example.json `
  config/local.json
```

Replace every placeholder in `config/local.json` with values from the Supabase
project dashboard, then run:

```powershell
.\run-local.ps1
```

`config/local.json` is ignored by Git. Use only the client-safe Supabase
publishable/anon key in Flutter, never a `service_role` key. Restart the
application after changing compile-time values; hot reload cannot change them.

Set the matching backend values in the ignored `server/.env`:

```env
PORT=3000
OPENAI_API_KEY=REAL_SERVER_ONLY_OPENAI_KEY
SUPABASE_URL=https://REAL_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=REAL_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
```

User passwords are sent only to Supabase Auth. Flutter sends the resulting short-lived Supabase access token to the backend. The OpenAI key remains server-only. Never use the Supabase database password as an application user password or put a `service_role` key in Flutter.

After configuring Supabase, create an account through **Create account** or invite a test user from **Authentication -> Users**. If email confirmation is enabled, confirm the address before signing in.

Before backend startup, run the secret-safe diagnostic:

```powershell
cd server
npm run check:config
npm start
```

The checker reports only `configured`, `missing`, or `placeholder`; it never prints credential values. Verify the public route only after startup succeeds:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:3000/health
```

Real authentication must be launched without UI bypass:

```powershell
flutter run -d windows `
  --dart-define=AI_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 `
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://REAL_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co `
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=REAL_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY `
  --dart-define=SKIP_AUTH_FOR_DEVELOPMENT=false
```

The backend requires Node.js 20 LTS or newer. On Windows, install the current Node.js LTS release, restart the terminal, and confirm:

```powershell
node --version
npm --version
```

1. Create an OpenAI API project and key and configure API billing.
2. In `server/`, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then replace the placeholder `OPENAI_API_KEY` and configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
3. Keep Terminal 1 running:

```powershell
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

4. In another terminal, require a successful health response before launching Flutter:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:3000/health
```

5. Keep Terminal 2 running with the matching URL:

```powershell
flutter run -d windows --dart-define=AI_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

The Windows helper `scripts/start-backend.ps1` performs runtime, `.env`, dependency, and port checks. macOS/Linux users can run `scripts/start-backend.sh`.

For Chrome, use:

```powershell
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=AI_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Android emulators must use `http://10.0.2.2:3000`; physical devices must use the development computer's LAN address and may require a firewall rule.

Staging:

```powershell
flutter run -d windows --dart-define=AI_BACKEND_URL=https://staging-api.example.com
```

Web production:

```powershell
flutter build web --release --base-href "/YOUR_REPOSITORY/" --dart-define=AI_BACKEND_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Android production:

```powershell
flutter run -d android --dart-define=AI_BACKEND_URL=https://api.example.com
```

Open Browse Cards, select a card, open it full screen, choose **Transcribe Card**, review and save the text, then choose **Discuss This Card**.

Supported image signatures are PNG, JPEG, and WebP, up to 20 MB. Images are base64-encoded into Responses API image inputs without modifying the original stored card file. Transcriptions and conversations persist by card ID.

The REST client uses `GET /health`, multipart `POST /api/cards/transcribe`, and JSON `POST /api/cards/chat`. Flutter Web relies on the proxy's `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` CORS allowlist. For Android emulators or physical devices, use the development computer's reachable emulator/LAN address instead of assuming `localhost` points to the computer. Prefer HTTPS outside local development; the Android manifest does not globally enable cleartext traffic.

## GitHub Pages deployment

Run the Web application locally:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=AI_BACKEND_URL=https://api.example.com
```

The deployment URL follows:

```text
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/uno2/
```

Enable Pages manually at:

```text
Repository -> Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment -> Source -> GitHub Actions
```

Configure the public HTTPS backend as a repository variable:

```text
Repository -> Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> Variables -> New repository variable
```

Use the variable name `AI_BACKEND_URL`. The backend must allow the GitHub Pages origin through its CORS allowlist. Never put an OpenAI key in this variable or in the Flutter build.

The workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` builds the nested `uno_chanson_2` Flutter project with `/uno2/` as its base href and deploys `build/web`. Flutter keeps hash-based routing, so nested views use URLs such as `#/settings` and refresh safely on Pages.

Normal updates:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update application"
git push
```

Every push to `main` triggers analysis, tests, a release Web build, and deployment. The local repository currently has no GitHub remote and its checked-out branch is `master`; add the remote and create/rename the deployment branch to `main` before the first push. If the eventual repository name is not `uno2`, update `GITHUB_PAGES_BASE_HREF` in the workflow.
